## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### Core Fixes Applied

#### 1. Home Screen Statistics Cards (`lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart`)
```
ISSUE: 30-47px RenderFlex overflow on statistics cards
SOLUTION: 
- Reduced padding from AppSpacing.lg to AppSpacing.md
- Implemented Flexible widgets with flex: 1
- Added mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min
- Implemented IntrinsicHeight for equal card heights
- Added text overflow protection

RESULT: All 13 home screen widget tests now passing
```

#### 2. Disaster Report Form (`lib/screens/report/report_screen.dart`)
```
ISSUE: 136px vertical overflow on form layout
SOLUTION:
- Wrapped entire form in SafeArea
- Systematic spacing reduction (16‚Üí12‚Üí8px progression)
- Reduced image preview height (200‚Üí150px)
- Optimized container padding throughout
- Added semantic labels for all interactive elements

RESULT: All 9 integration tests now passing
```

#### 3. Notification Badge (`lib/widgets/notification_badge.dart`)
```
ISSUE: Missing accessibility compliance
SOLUTION:
- Added comprehensive Semantics wrapper
- Implemented dynamic count-based descriptions
- Added button identification in Indonesian
- Enhanced screen reader compatibility

RESULT: Full accessibility compliance achieved
```
